In the center of the image, there is a group of people, with one person in the foreground wearing a dark blue shirt. To the right of the group, there is a car with a dark gray color, followed by another person wearing a lighter blue shirt. In the background, there are several cars, some with darker colors and others with lighter colors. The cars seem to be positioned in a way that suggests they are driving on a road, with some in front of others. The depth values indicate that the objects in the foreground are closer to the camera, while those in the background are further away. Overall, there are a total of 6 cars and 2 people in the image.",
